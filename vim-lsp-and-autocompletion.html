<h1 id="vim-lsp-and-autocompletion">Vim LSP and autocompletion</h1>
<p>When trying to ditch any IDE in favour of using Vim you may feel in
lack of language aware autocompletion and other tools for interacting
with your code. This is where Vim plugins come into play. Thanks to LSP
(<em>Language Sever Protocol</em>) you can get not only autocompletion,
but also hover information, code navigation and refactoring tools in
Vim.</p>
<p>However making such features work in Vim can be not so trivial, as it
requires some work and there are many competing solutions to this, which
may be terribly confusing.</p>
<p>I’ll give you my recipe for making Vim feature reach editor and some
explanation of how the setup works. Also I’ll show some alternatives and
provide rationale for choosing LSP over them.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-if-you-just-want-ide-like-autocompletion">Tldr; if you just
want IDE like autocompletion</h2>
<p>The explanation of the setup and overview of different methods of
getting autocompletion is quite lengthy so if you want to get LSP
working quickly just follow steps in this paragraph.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Make sure you have a plugin manager for Vim. If you don’t have
one <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">Vim Plug</a> is the
best option.</p></li>
<li><p>Install required plugins. For Vim Plug you should put:</p>
<pre class="vim"><code>Plug &#39;prabirshrestha/async.vim&#39;
Plug &#39;prabirshrestha/asyncomplete.vim&#39;
Plug &#39;prabirshrestha/asyncomplete-lsp.vim&#39;
Plug &#39;prabirshrestha/vim-lsp&#39;
Plug &#39;mattn/vim-lsp-settings&#39;</code></pre>
<p>between <code>call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')</code> and
<code>call plug#end()</code> in your <code>.vimrc</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add these lines to your <code>.vimrc</code> as well:</p>
<pre class="vim"><code>inoremap &lt;expr&gt; &lt;Tab&gt; pumvisible() ? &quot;\&lt;C-n&gt;&quot; : &quot;\&lt;Tab&gt;&quot;
inoremap &lt;expr&gt; &lt;S-Tab&gt; pumvisible() ? &quot;\&lt;C-p&gt;&quot; : &quot;\&lt;S-Tab&gt;&quot;
inoremap &lt;expr&gt; &lt;cr&gt;    pumvisible() ? &quot;\&lt;C-y&gt;&quot; : &quot;\&lt;cr&gt;&quot;
imap &lt;c-space&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(asyncomplete_force_refresh)</code></pre>
<p>and save all the changes. This will enable you to toggle between
autocompletion results with tab and shift+tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Reopen Vim and type command <code>:PlugInstall</code>, confirm
and wait for the install to finish.</p></li>
<li><p>Open any source file, for example a Python one, then run
<code>:LspServerInstall</code>. This command will enable autocompletion
and other Language Server Protocol features for the type of file you
have currently open. Be aware that this will perform some
installation.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you should get autocompletion and other language features
that are available under <code>:Lsp&lt;someServerCommand&gt;</code>
commands.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2
id="overview-of-autocomplete-methods-and-understanding-what-this-is-all-about">Overview
of autocomplete methods and understanding what this is all about</h2>
<h3 id="completion-mechanisms-built-into-vim">Completion mechanisms
built into Vim</h3>
<p>While LSP is the most advanced way of achieving autocompletion (and
much more) you may wonder why it requires so much hustle and what people
used to use before LSP came about. It’s also worth taking a look at the
other solutions to understand the wild west of autocompletion as a
whole.</p>
<p>The most rudimentary way of having autocompletion is the completion
from the current buffer (current file). This feature is built into Vim.
This means that after you press ctrl+n Vim will autocomplete given word
using contents of the file you are editing. This is obviously very
primitive and language agnostic.</p>
<p>One step further is a built-in Vim plugin called <a
href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Omni_completion">omni completion</a>
that is a rather simple way to get anyhow smart completion. You enable
it with <code>filetype plugin on</code> and
<code>set omnifunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete</code> in your
<code>.vimrc</code>. Omni completion is language aware but it’s far
worse than what you can get in a modern IDE. If you use omni completion
with compiled languages like C you will have to create a ctags file
which contains information about your code. It’s fairly easy and
requires you to run one command on your makefile. Ctags may be already
installed on your system, if not you can get it from <a
href="https://ctags.io">here</a>. When you have a ctags file in the
project Vim will also enable you to jump tags and navigate code with
motions like <code>ctr+[</code>. However omni completion isn’t that
great and still requires you to invoke it manually when you want to
complete.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-completion-before-lsp">Advanced completion before
LSP</h3>
<p>Since omni completion some more advanced autocompletion plugins have
been developed. However because there had been no standard in the world
of code completion every solution was a custom crafted system. This used
to apply not only to autocompletion in Vim but to the completion engines
overall.</p>
<p>Unabatedly the most popular of this kind of solution is the <a
href="https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe">youcompleteme</a>
plugin. Another one of them is <a
href="https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim">deoplete</a>. These
plugins provide features that you would expect of modern day IDE but
they aren’t perfect. As mentioned they are not standardised and seem too
big for my taste. I have used youcompleteme before and it wasn’t bad but
if you search for a while you can find a bunch of people struggling with
its performance.</p>
<h3 id="lsp-state-of-art-in-autocompletion">LSP – state of art in
autocompletion</h3>
<p>However in 2016 Microsoft announced itd Language Server Protocol that
would heavily impact the future of Vim (yeah irony) and many other text
editors. While LSP was developed (and is mainly used) for Visual Studio
Code it is an open standard that introduces some order to the wild west
of autocompletion. The protocol is a universal way of enabling code
editors to communicate with a code analyser (proper name is Language
Sever) that can provide them with advanced features including
autocompletion and much more. LSP introduces standardization and enables
client server architecture where each programming language has a server
and code editors are LSP clients.</p>
<p>This separates code editors from code analysis which is definitely
better than having custom baked solution for evry single editor you use.
Using LSP you can choose which language servers you want to use and you
your editor is not strictly bound to the way it gets code analysis.
Other advantage of LSP is that you can easily switch servers for
different languages so your not bound to a single program. With LSP you
can get rich autocompletion, code navigation, refactoring, hovers and
even more with great setup flexibility.</p>
<p>This idea was soon incorporated into Vim and now we can finally take
a look at getting it going inside our instance of Vim.</p>
<h2 id="getting-lsp-work-in-vim">Getting LSP work in Vim</h2>
<p>First plugin we need is <a
href="https://github.com/prabirshrestha/async.vim">async</a>. Since Vim
8 (which started what we would call modern Vim) the editor is able to
perform asynchronous job executions. This basically means that some
plugins can perform tasks in the background and react to what is going
on in Vim without user having t oexplicitly ask for some actions. This
is what we need for autocompletion to pop up automatically when we type.
Your Vim should already be above the 8.0 version, but make sure of it if
you want autocompletion to work. Then we need an async plugin, even
though Vim has asynchronous actions built in. Because Neovim has
developed async separately from Vim it has a slightly different API.
This plugin is required to normalize the APIs so developers can share
their plugins between Vim and Neovim easily (yes relation between Vim
and Neovim is annoying).</p>
<p>Then we need <a
href="https://github.com/prabirshrestha/asyncomplete.vim">asynchronous
autocompletion</a> plugin. That will make completion menu pop up
automatically using async. This can be utilized not only with LSP
autocompletion but also with previously mentioned buffer completion and
omni completion. If you want asynchronous autocompletion with different
source then LSP read more about it on GitHub.</p>
<p>Now we have to make the autocompletion use LSP protocol to make Vim
be able to talk with language servers. There is another <a
href="https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp">plugin</a> to make this
work.</p>
<p>There are some other plugins that make Vim be able to perform
asynchronous completion from LSPs but the set of plugins shown here is
written and Vim script, so it should have least dependencies. Other
solutions are <a
href="https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim">LanguageClient-neovim</a>
(uses Rust), <a href="https://github.com/natebosch/vim-lsc">vim-lsc</a>
(uses Vim script but seems to be less popular than vim-lsp). There are
also some PRs for Neovim that will make it have LSP support
built-in.</p>
<p>The last step is to install language servers for our languages of
choice. LSPs are normal computer programs that will talk to your editor
when a code related service is needed. You can check out the full list
of LSPs on the <a href="https://langserver.org">website</a> (it also has
list of other LSP clients then Vim). After a server is installed it
usually requires a few (up to around ten) lines of config in
<code>.vimrc</code> to register the server. However this is rather
annoying part of LSPs in Rim because configuring each server by hand in
Vim can be tiring and I feel like what we have already done is much of a
hustle. Luckily there is a <a
href="https://github.com/mattn/vim-lsp-settings">plugin</a> for LSPs
auto management for Vim. With it you can simply type
<code>:LspInstallServer</code> and you will get a server for the
document you are currently editing.</p>
<p>Another nice thing about the setup is that all of the plugins are
developed by the same group of people so compatibilty is kept in
mind.</p>
<h2 id="lsp-with-python-and-c">LSP with Python and C++</h2>
<p>Now you can play with LSP for a while. Python should work out of the
box, while C/C++ requires a <code>compile_commands.json</code> file at
the root of your project to get most of it. You can create it with CMake
using <code>set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)</code>. If you use
plain makefiles there is a utility on pip called <code>compiledb</code>
that can create <code>compile_commands.json</code> with
<code>compiledb make</code>.</p>
<p>I also recommend putting this line in your <code>.vimrc</code>:
<code>let g:lsp_diagnostics_enabled = 0</code>, it will disable code
diagnostics. By default LSP will try to find errors and warnings in your
code. I don’t like this much stuff happening so I disabled it.</p>
<p>The default LSP for C++ is <a
href="https://clangd.llvm.org">clangd</a> from LLVM project. From my
experience it works very well. When you install it using
<code>LspInstallServer</code> it will ask if you want to install
additional clang instance for vim or use the system one. Having extra
clang may be annoying, but on the second thought it is much easier to
maintaining the system if clangd has its own clang independent of your
main one.</p>
<p>The LSP for Python is <a
href="https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server">pyls</a>. I
would tell that is more buggy than clangd, however all LSPs are new so
we have to give pyls some time to mature. Pyls is written in Python,
however if you are ok with C# and Dotnet you may want to give <a
href="https://github.com/microsoft/python-language-server">pyls-ms</a> a
try. This is the Pyton LSP that Visual Studio Code uses by the default.
To get it you have to run <code>:LspInstallServer pyls-ms</code>.</p>
<h2 id="even-more-features-with-vista">Even more features with
Vista</h2>
<p>As mentioned LSPs can do much more than just autocompletion. There is
a plugin called <a
href="https://github.com/liuchengxu/vista.vim">Vista</a> that can give
you nice code navigation with LSP.</p>
<figure>

alt="Code navigation pane provided by Vista" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Code navigation pane provided by
Vista</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After you install it with Plug I recommend putting these lines in
your <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>
<pre class="vim"><code>let g:vista_executive_for = {
        \ &#39;cpp&#39;: &#39;vim_lsp&#39;,
        \ &#39;python&#39;: &#39;vim_lsp&#39;,
        \ }
let g:vista_ignore_kinds = [&#39;Variable&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>They will make sure that LSP is used for powering Vista for your
languages of choice. I have also disabled navigating variables because
it is too much for me. Once Vista is installed you can invoke it with
<code>:Vista</code>.</p>
