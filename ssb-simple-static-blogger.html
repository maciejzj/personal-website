<h1 id="simple-static-blogger">Simple static blogger</h1>
<p>I decided to create this website to share my tech related work. However I discovered that the mainstream tools for blogging are not so great if you want to make a very simple and effortless website. Popular tools often seem to be too convoluted (there are Hugo tutorials on the Youtube that last dozens of minutes) for my use case. Surely, there are many great tools, but I wanted something bare-bones simple that would require no learning and have as few dependencies as possible. After a few minutes of research I decided to write my own blog framework in form of a shell script (there are some bash static site generators but I decided to make something even simpler and make my own thing for fun).</p>
<p>This was my motivation for creating a simple static blogger - anti-framework for generating static sites and blogs that tries to follow suckless philosophy of creating software.</p>
<p>Ssb is heavily inspired and based on <a href="https://benedicthenshaw.com/static_site.html">this</a> post.</p>
